## Site Screening Score Recap

100-point rubric across 5 categories:

| Category | Points | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Pickup/Dropoff | 25 | Traffic flow, parking, parent queue space |
| Parent Perception | 25 | Safety feel, neighborhood quality, curb appeal |
| Parks & Outdoor | 20 | Proximity to parks, playgrounds, outdoor space |
| Building Quality | 20 | Condition, layout, natural light, HVAC |
| Adjacent Risk | 10 | Problem neighbors (bars, cannabis, adult, etc.) |

| Rating | Score | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| GREEN | ≥85 | Site is viable — proceed |
| AMBER | 70-84 | Site has issues — proceed with caution |
| RED | <70 | Site has significant issues — generate TODOs |
